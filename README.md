# Address_Generator
A java address generator.

Usage: java -jar \<Addr gen file.jar> \<Threads> \<How many addresses to find> \<Words to search for seperated by spaces>

Output will be put in AddrGenResult.txt ( I think... )

Planned features:

1. Only search from the beginning of the address for matches.
